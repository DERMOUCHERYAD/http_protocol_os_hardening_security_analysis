# YummyRecipes Security Incident Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of a security incident involving a brute force attack and the distribution of a malicious file on the yummyrecipesforme.com website. The incident led to unauthorized access to the admin account and compromised the computers of several users.

## Incident Summary
- **Date:** August 28, 2024
- **Affected Systems:** Yummyrecipesforme.com web server and users' personal computers
- **Type of Attack:** Brute force attack, malicious file distribution

## Incident Details
Several customers reported being prompted to download and run a file claiming to offer access to new recipes. After executing the file, their computers began operating slowly, suggesting a compromise. The website owner found themselves locked out of the admin account, indicating a potential brute force attack.

A cybersecurity analyst conducted a detailed investigation using a sandbox environment and `tcpdump` to capture network traffic. The analysis revealed that the attack involved:
- A brute force attack on the admin account.
- The injection of malicious code into the website, which prompted users to download a harmful file disguised as a browser update.
- The redirection of traffic to a fake website, greatrecipesforme.com, after the file was executed.

### Attack Mechanism
The attack began with a targeted brute force attempt on the admin account, allowing unauthorized access to the website’s backend. The attacker exploited this access to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website’s pages. This code tricked users into downloading a malicious file that masqueraded as an update, thereby distributing malware.

### Malicious File Impact
The downloaded file, once executed, compromised the end users' systems by introducing malware designed to cause performance issues and potentially exfiltrate data. The redirection to a fake website further facilitated the attack, possibly to capture sensitive information or spread additional malicious content.
